    <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <p>As a client, I decided to create a website about learning Spanish, mainly because that is my first language and I love teaching people how to speak it and about my culture.
          For the images, I chose to use ChatGPT to generate images that matched my color palette and would be friendly enough to encourage people to learn the language. 
          I did my best to stay in communication with my lead developer, but I wish he had taken more initiative to discuss the changes made and not made to my page. 
          I am somewhat satisfied with the final result since the CSS is not included, and I would have liked to see more of my ideas implemented in the page. 
          Next time I hire a team, I plan to have more meetings with my lead developer and the junior developer so I can better understand the process and the changes that are made.</p>
    
     <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <p>As a Lead Developer, I believe I did my best to communicate and ask questions to my client to see if he wanted to add new items or make changes to his website.
          Although I didn't always receive a response, I was able to determine with my team what the client wanted based on the wireframe that was sent to me earlier.
          I contacted my junior developers via email, and during class, I assigned them the pages they needed to edit and answered any questions they had. This was my first time using GitHub in a team, and I think it went very well. We were all able to figure it out and complete the webpage.  </p>

     <h2>Jr Developer Report</h2>
        <p>I think this was a great experience. I was able to communicate clearly with my Lead Developer via email and in person.
          The lead developer was able to explain clearly what I needed to do on the website, and I had no problems using GitHub.</p>

     <h2>General experience Report</h2>
        <p>I think the most challenging part of this project is communicating with the people I was going to work with. As I previously answered, I was able to overcome it to follow up constantly with people I needed an answer from. 
What I enjoy most about this project was creating the webpage, putting everything I learned in this course into practice was fun!
I think this is a great project. At first, it was confusing, but Brother Alvey was able to explain it in a way we all were able to understand and work towards the project. But overall, I do not think there is anything I would like to change about the project.
I think this project and the course in general prepared me to work on real-world projects, as I feel more confident in my knowledge and skills in HTML and CSS.</p>
